  "content": "<h2>Why Chicago Lawns Are Challenging</h2><p>Chicago’s heavy clay soil, humidity, and freeze–thaw cycles make lawn establishment difficult. Grass seed struggles to germinate evenly, and weeds often take over before the lawn is mature. Sod offers instant curb appeal, but it comes with higher upfront cost.</p><h2>Benefits of Sod</h2><p>Sod provides a fully grown lawn in just one day. It eliminates bare soil, reduces erosion, and keeps weeds from establishing. For homeowners with upcoming events or new construction, sod is the fastest way to achieve a finished yard.</p><h2>Benefits of Seed</h2><p>Seed is more affordable and allows for a wider variety of grass types. It is best for large properties, budget projects, or homeowners who enjoy ongoing maintenance. However, seed requires patience and weeks of watering.</p><h2>Which Option Handles Chicago Weather Better?</h2><p>Sod typically handles Chicago’s climate more reliably. High-quality bluegrass sod is grown locally and adapted to Illinois conditions. Seed can succeed, but it requires ideal timing — usually early fall or late spring.</p><h2>Maintenance Differences</h2><p><strong>Sod:</strong> Needs watering for the first 10–14 days but becomes usable quickly.<br><strong>Seed:</strong> Requires strict watering, weed control, and patience while the lawn fills in.</p><h2>When Seed Makes Sense</h2><p>Seed is the better choice for:</p><p>• Large properties on a budget<br>• Overseeding existing lawns<br>• Filling in repaired areas<br>• Homeowners who enjoy lawn care</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Both sod and seed can produce a beautiful Chicago lawn — the best option depends on your timeline and maintenance commitment.</p><p><strong>If you want instant results, sod is the clear winner.

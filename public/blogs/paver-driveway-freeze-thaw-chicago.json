  "intro": "Chicago’s brutal freeze–thaw cycles destroy concrete and asphalt every year. Homeowners considering a paver driveway often ask the same question: can pavers survive our winters without cracking? The short answer — yes, if installed correctly.",

  "content": "<h2>Why Concrete and Asphalt Fail in Chicago</h2><p>The Chicago region experiences dozens of freeze–thaw cycles each winter. When water seeps into tiny cracks in concrete or asphalt, it freezes, expands, and forcefully breaks apart the surface. Over time, this leads to large cracks, heaving, sinking, and potholes. Solid slabs simply cannot flex with ground movement, which is why so many driveways break down within a few years.</p><h2>How Pavers Avoid Cracking</h2><p>Pavers are made up of individual units rather than a single slab. Each piece interlocks but can move independently during soil expansion or contraction. This flexibility is why pavers rarely crack — they shift slightly with the ground instead of fighting against it.</p>

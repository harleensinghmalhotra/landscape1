  "content": "<h2>Why Erosion Happens</h2><p>Sloped yards, poor soil structure, downspout placement, and heavy rainfall are the biggest causes of backyard erosion in Cook County. Over time, soil can wash away, exposing roots, damaging patios, and threatening foundations.</p><h2>Solution #1: Retaining Walls</h2><p>Retaining walls hold soil in place and create usable flat space. Engineered Unilock systems and natural boulder walls are the most common choices in Illinois.</p><h2>Solution #2: Paver Systems</h2><p>Pavers offer better drainage than poured concrete and help reduce runoff. Permeable pavers go a step further by allowing water to filter into the ground below.</p><h2>Solution #3: Dry Creek Beds</h2><p>These designer drainage features guide water away naturally while adding a beautiful accent to the landscape.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Erosion won’t solve itself. Proper hardscaping protects your home and improves your landscape’s longevity.</p><p><strong>Contact us for a property assessment and customized erosion control plan.</strong></p>"

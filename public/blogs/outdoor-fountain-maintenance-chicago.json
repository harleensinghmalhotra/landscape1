Freezing temperatures can cause internal cracking and total pump failure.</p><h2>Refill During Summer</h2><p>Evaporation is high in hot months, so topping off water levels is important to keep the pump submerged and functional.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A well-maintained fountain adds beauty and peaceful sound to your outdoor space.</p><p><strong>For seasonal service or repairs, our technicians are ready to help.</strong></p>"

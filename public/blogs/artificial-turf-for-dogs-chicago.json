  "content": "<h2>Why Dogs Ruin Natural Grass</h2><p>Dog urine burns grass, heavy traffic compacts soil, and rainy weather turns lawns into mud pits. Chicago’s freeze-thaw cycles make natural grass even more fragile. Pet owners spend hundreds every year reseeding, patching, and repairing their lawns—only to see the same problems return.</p><h2>How Artificial Turf Solves These Issues</h2><p>Modern turf systems are engineered specifically for pets. High-quality turf includes drainage holes, odor-resistant infill, and antimicrobial backing. When installed with a proper base, it drains water instantly, meaning no mud, no puddles, and no urine-soaked grass.</p><h2>Is Turf Safe for Dogs?</h2><p>Yes. Pet-grade turf is non-toxic, soft on paws, and cooler than older turf materials. In Chicago, most systems use a permeable gravel base to allow rapid drainage—even during heavy rain.</p><h2>Maintenance: Easier Than Real Grass</h2><p>Artificial turf requires brushing and occasional rinsing. Enzyme cleaners remove odors easily. Compared to mowing, watering, and fertilizing, turf is extremely low-maintenance.</p><h2>Cost Breakdown</h2><p>In Chicago, artificial turf installation typically costs <strong>$15–$28 per square foot</strong> depending on the base depth, type of turf, and access to the yard. While this is more expensive upfront, the long-term savings and convenience make it worth it for many homeowners.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Artificial turf is a great investment for dog owners tired of mud, dead grass, and constant cleanup.</p><p><strong>If you're considering turf for your yard or dog run, we can design a custom installation tailored to your space.

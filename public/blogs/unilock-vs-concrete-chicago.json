  "intro": "Chicago homeowners often choose between Unilock pavers and stamped concrete when building a patio, driveway, or walkway. Both look great on day one—but only one truly lasts through brutal freeze-thaw cycles. Here’s a detailed comparison.",

  "content": "<h2>Why Chicago Winters Destroy Outdoor Surfaces</h2><p>Chicago experiences some of the most extreme freeze-thaw cycles in the Midwest. Water seeps into tiny cracks, freezes, expands, and damages the material. This is why so many concrete patios crack within just a few years. Materials that can't flex or drain properly simply won't last in Illinois weather.</p><h2>Stamped Concrete Overview</h2><p>Stamped concrete is poured as a single slab and then colored or textured to mimic stone. It looks elegant at first, but its rigid structure makes it vulnerable. Once cracking begins, it cannot be spot-repaired without visible seams. In Chicago, stamped concrete typically lasts 5–10 years before showing significant wear.</p><h2>Unilock Pavers Overview</h2><p>Unilock pavers are individual, interlocking concrete units designed for flexibility and drainage. Each paver moves independently during freeze-thaw shifts, preventing large cracks. If damage occurs, individual pieces can be replaced—making long-term maintenance simple.</p><h2>Performance Comparison</h2><p><strong>Durability:</strong> Stamped concrete cracks easily. Unilock pavers flex and last 25+ years.</p><p><strong>Winter Safety:</strong> Pavers provide more traction, and permeable versions reduce ice formation.</p><p><strong>Repairs:</strong> Concrete requires full replacement. Pavers allow easy spot fixes.</p><p><strong>Drainage:</strong> Stamped concrete traps water. Pavers can be built permeable to drain water naturally.</p><h2>Cost Differences</h2><p>Stamped concrete is usually cheaper upfront, but long-term maintenance makes it more expensive over time. Unilock pavers cost more initially, but they last longer, require less maintenance, and increase home value.</p><h2>Visual Appearance</h2><p>Concrete fades and cracks. Pavers maintain their look, with fade-resistant colors and endless design patterns. Unilock offers premium textures and tones that mimic natural stone far more convincingly than stamped patterns.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If your priority is longevity, winter durability, and premium aesthetics, Unilock is the better investment for Chicago homes.</p><p><strong>Need help choosing the right hardscape system?

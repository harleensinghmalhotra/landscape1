  "content": "<h2>Why Koi Ponds Need Winter Preparation</h2><p>As temperatures drop, your pond’s ecosystem slows down. Beneficial bacteria become less active, fish metabolism decreases, and freezing water can threaten pumps and plumbing. Preparing early prevents stress on your koi and protects expensive equipment.</p><h2>Step 1: Clean the Pond Thoroughly</h2><p>Remove leaves, sludge, and debris before winter. Organic waste produces harmful gases under ice, which can be deadly in a sealed pond. A clean pond promotes healthier water quality during winter dormancy.</p><h2>Step 2: Switch to Cold-Weather Fish Food</h2><p>Koi digest protein poorly in cold water. Switching to wheat-germ-based food helps their system slow down safely before they enter semi-hibernation.</p><h2>Step 3: Install a Pond Heater or De-Icer</h2><p>A floating de-icer keeps a small opening in the ice, allowing toxic gases to escape. This small opening is essential for fish survival — it prevents oxygen depletion beneath frozen water.</p><h2>Step 4: Remove or Protect the Pump</h2><p>Most Chicago pond pumps should be removed and stored indoors for winter. If your pump remains in place, it must be positioned deep enough to avoid freezing temperatures.</p><h2>Step 5: Trim and Winterize Aquatic Plants</h2><p>Marginal plants should be cut back, and tropical plants brought indoors. Hardy plants can stay but may need trimming.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Proper winterization protects your koi and preserves your pond’s health through the coldest months.</p><p><strong>Need help winterizing your pond?

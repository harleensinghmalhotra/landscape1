  "content": "<h2>Why Kentucky Bluegrass Thrives in Chicago</h2><p>Kentucky bluegrass is uniquely suited to Chicago’s climate. It tolerates cold winters, recovers quickly from damage, and forms a thick, carpet-like lawn. Homeowners love it because it looks premium and feels soft underfoot.</p><h2>Sod vs. Seed</h2><p>While seed is cheaper upfront, it can take months to fill in and requires constant watering. Sod provides instant coverage, prevents erosion, and eliminates weeds from the start. For busy homeowners, sod is the far superior option.</p><h2>What Makes Bluegrass Sod Special?</h2><p>Kentucky bluegrass spreads through underground stems called rhizomes. This allows it to self-repair, fill gaps, and stay thick even in high-traffic areas. Illinois summers can be harsh, but bluegrass handles heat better than most cool-season grasses.</p><h2>Installation Process</h2><p>A proper installation includes removing old lawn, regrading the soil, installing fresh topsoil, and laying the sod in staggered rows. Rolling and watering help the roots establish within 10–14 days.</p><h2>Maintenance Tips</h2><p>Mow at 2.5–3 inches, water deeply but infrequently, and fertilize in spring and fall. With proper care, a bluegrass sod lawn stays beautiful for years.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Kentucky bluegrass sod is the best choice for Chicago homeowners who want instant results and long-term performance.</p><p><strong>Want a flawless new lawn?
